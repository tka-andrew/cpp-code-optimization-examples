# Cpp Code Optimization Examples
This is a simple project that contains some sample codes to demonstrate the c++ optimization techniques and also to show how much is the difference before and after optimization. However, take note that the results obtained should not be used as a benchmark because the execution time of a program is affected by lots of factors and is not consistent. The main focus of this repo is to demonstrate how C++ code can be optimized.
